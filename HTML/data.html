        <p>The data used in this analysis was pulled from two sources, both from Kaggle:</p>
        <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/heesoo37/120-years-of-olympic-history-athletes-and-results?select=athlete_events.csv">Athlete Data</a>
        <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/jayrav13/olympic-track-field-results">Event Data</a>
        <p>The data from these sources was scraped from sports-reference.com and olimpic.org, respectively. The data from the Olympics website is definitely reputable because they host the events that I'm analysing in the data. Sports reference is less official than the official website for the Olympics, but a quick scan of the data shows that the two sites match up on data.</p>
        <p>The athlete data from Sports Reference contains the miscellaneous information about all of the athletes, including nationality, which Olympics they competed in, etc. More importantly, this data contains the height and weight information that I used for the data analysis. The event data scraped from olympic.org contains the specific event information for how each athlete did in the events that they competed in. I combined this with the height and weight information from the other data set to analyze the relationship between the weight/height ratio and the event result.
